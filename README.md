I have experience with the following: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Currently working with the MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack for personal projects.

My interests include writing code, trying new recipes, outdoor activities(hiking, biking, etc.), and playing with my dog.
